# Computer Browser
### Final project for CS 30
By pressing run on replit you can start searching with a friendly start page that is welcoming for any user that uses a web browser and is looking for a solution to having one tab web browser. Searching in lower case and with proper spelling will give the user the result. The user can also quit using the web browser by typing quit. This program is different from other web browsers because it satys open on one tab and doesn't prompt the user to add more tabs to search.
