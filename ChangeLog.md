## Alpha Version
### Atributes and Websites
- Giving three variables names for each website will take a lot of space on the code and will take a lot of time to create. This problem can be fixed with classes in the beta version. 
### Logo and Browser Name 
- Giving a logo will make the browser look more inviting for people to use. A name for the browser would also help the with the logo idea and needs to be added in the beta version.
### List of Websites
- A list of websites that are on the browser would be nice but would not be easily accesible to the public because the users shouldn't need a list of websites that they can search from when they just need to search it.
