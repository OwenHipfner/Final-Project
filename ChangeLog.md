## Alpha Version
### Atributes and Websites
- Giving three variables names for each website will take a lot of space on the code and will take a lot of time to create. This problem can be fixed with classes in the beta version. 
### Logo and Browser Name 
- Giving a logo will make the browser look more inviting for people to use. A name for the browser would also help the with the logo idea and needs to be added in the beta version.
### List of Websites
- A list of websites that are on the browser would be nice but would not be easily accesible to the public because the users shouldn't need a list of websites that they can search from when they just need to search it. 
## Beta Version
### Beta testers
- I had three people test my code and give input on the code. All three testers said that the program was easy to use. I then asked if I should put a list of the websites avalible for the code. Two people said they would want a list to see there options. One person said it would defeat the perpose of randomly searching for a website. One user said a spell checker if the user types something wrong a error and way to fix will be made. Thats difficult but can try to find a solution. Another user said it looks fine. The last user said to add a history.
### More Space for Websites 
- Having more space for websites would be beneficial to my project. I think if I put the atributes in with the users input I can open a lot of space for more websites instead of having them outside and having lots of lines of code. 
### History 
- One beta tester said to have a history of websites searched. The addition of this is very simple by using a text file and when a website is searched it will go to the text file. Then the user can open the historie and be able to find the websites that they searched previously.
### Search Error 
- The search error would be difficult but if I could give the user some help by giving the list of websites when they mess up and find the answer they want. 

"It sucks" - Zana, this is from a hater. See many people put others down and dont appreciate the goodness others bring into the world.
